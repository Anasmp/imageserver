The API allows you to send a POST request to the server with the image file as the payload. The server will then store the image on the public server and return a URL that you can use to access the image.

API
The API provides a single endpoint for uploading images:

bash
Copy code
POST /image/upload-image
The endpoint expects a multipart/form-data payload with a single field named file. The image field should contain the image file that you want to upload.

The endpoint returns a JSON response with the following fields:

success - A boolean value indicating whether the upload was successful.
message - A string message describing the result of the upload.
url - A string containing the URL of the uploaded image.
You can use the url field to display the uploaded image on your website or application.
